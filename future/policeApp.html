<h3>Police is a progressive web application that can be used in iOS and Androids devices for users to report minor car accidents to collision centres.</h3>

<!--Background-->
<h3>Background</h3>
  <p>For my Mobile Web Development class I teamed up with classmates to create a project that implemented Javascript and API frameworks. Our concept came into focus as we created rapid prototypes to deliver the main focus, which resulted in the usage of a gps, calendar, and camera. The involvement of the collision centre was finalized as there is little to no applicaiton that collision centres have intergrated in their services.</p>

<!--Research-->
  <h3>Research</h3>
  <p>1. Challenge</p>
    <p>Our challege designing the application was collecting enough data to add to our core feature. Due to legal rules, our communication with collsiion centers were all restricted to online sources or users who were involved in minor incidents. This led to cutting the scope of the project. Originally, we wanted to create a form that would be sent to officers and collision centres, but we had to cut it to collision centres recieveing and approving the forms </p>
