<h3>The Interactive Mirror Journey (IMJ) is an infinity mirror that interacts with the user and guides them to the Sheridan Life Radio (SLR) live station. The mirror will include a mini infinity tunnel that with an NFC sticker inside which will direct them to an interactive site filled with SLR podcast samples and links to SLR related content</h3>

<!--Background-->
<h3>Background</h3>
  <p>Sheridan Life Radio is trying to increase listeners for their podcasts and radio station. Their original idea mentioned using an NFC sticker on a poster to draw attention. To follow their idea, the IMJ will not only amuse students, but allow them to hear the radio station live while playing with cool lights. IMJ will target students by providing response LED lights</p>

  <h3>Challenge</h3>
    <p>The challenge behind this project was trying to find a way for students to listen to the radio station. Initially, the original idea of the project from the client was to have a poster with the NFC stick leading students to the their website. </p>
    <p>With access to our Arduino the scope of the project expanded.</p>
    <p>How will this grab the attention of a student to tap their phone on the NFC sticker?</p>

    <h3>Research</h3>
      <p>Initially, we wanted people to go through a journey as our interaction with the concept of a mirror with really cool lights. We asked students around campus to get their take on LED lights, and since most were not in the technology sector, they found lights "cool looking" and "attention grabbing". We then created a journey that would guide them to tap their device on the sticker</p>

    </div>

      <p>Problems</p>
      <ul>
        <li>We wanted to add a program board on top of the mirror to specify what SLR stands for, however, the average price is between fifty to two-hundred dollars</li>
        <li>The mini infinity mirror we wanted to use to input the NFC sticker is sold out and the company put the item on hold. They were not able to make any special arrangements to have the item shipped to us</li>
        <li>We wanted to incorporate a motion sensor to the lights around the mirror, however, we had difficulty getting the motion detector to work</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Breakthroughs</p>
      <p>Even though we pushed to complete our project timeline closer to the presentation date, we were able to successfully have our mirror frame, design, and base of program functionalities put together. Thanks to the help of classmates, relatives, and instructors, we were able to have a project ready to present.</p>
      <!-- Reflection -->
      <h3>Reflection</h3>
      <p>We found several things interesting about the development of the project. Our initial idea was broken down due to the lack of installation experience we have, and the outrageous price of materials needed to build the mirror. Even though we were not happy with what we wanted to complete for the presentation, the wow factor of the project had pleasant reviews</p>
